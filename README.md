# Abstract:
In the Context of Global Healthcare, chest X-ray imaging has become a vital tool for diagnosing and assessing lung conditions. In this study, we focus on improving the prediction accuracy of lung diseases from chest X-rays using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and applying preprocessing algorithms to enhance image quality. We utilized the Chest-Xray14 (2017) and CheXpert datasets, which contain thousands of chest X-ray images covering diverse lung pathologies.
To enhance image quality, we implemented preprocessing techniques, including:
	•	Background Removal (eliminating non-relevant regions),
	•	Noise Removal (reducing image artifacts),
	•	Diaphragm Removal (removing diaphragm interference),
	•	Contrast Enrichment (improving visual clarity).
These algorithms effectively cleaned the images, removed noise, and highlighted critical details in the X-rays. We then developed a suite of CNN models, including Dense121, VGG19, EfficientNetV2, and ConvNeXt.
